Buddypress Search is a fast light member search plugin,typing member name, showing user list instantly in drop-down list, not need refresh page

== Description ==

Buddypress Search is  a fast and light buddypress member search plugin to help users search buddypress members more faster, users do not need click submit button to refresh the BP members page. 
When users type buddypress members name, we will show related members instantly in a drop-down member list, the plugin drived by AngularJS.

Why I develop this BuddyPress Search plugin?

I designed a few large buddypress sites, some of them have complex functionality in buddypress member page, for example distance, online status, user videos, matching and sorting... and so on.
  
This means when users search buddypress members in "Search Members" search box in members page -- yourdomain.com/members, after click the "Search" button in "Search Members" search box,
We need refresh the members page and users need waiting a few seconds and all functionliaty in members page will it wastes server resources.
 
So I re-developed the buddypress member search box to offer a fast search result.
 
When users search members, once he typed one character, we start to show related members with user links instantly in a drop-down box, this running fast and users do not need to refresh the member page.

 Of course, users still can click search submit button to the get member lists in a search result page, if they want. All of your buddypress search functionality did not be changed, I just inject new functionality into buddypress default members search box via AngularJS.

More amazing features are being developed and any feature request is welcome.
