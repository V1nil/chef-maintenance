<h3>Additional Features with the Pro Addon</h3>

<p>This plugin is financed by the awesome buyers of the <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">Pro Addon</a>. The development and support of this plugins has become a almost full time job for me so I hope you understand that I can not make all features gratis and that you <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">purchase it</a> to support the develoment.</p>

<ul class="list-checked">
	<li><strong>Feel good about yourself</strong><br>
		for supporting my long time work on this plugin. Tons of hours, weekends â€¦ always worked on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/changelog/">improving it</a> 3+ years.</li>

	<li><strong>Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)</strong><br>
		For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. <strong>Prevent video hosters to lead your visitors away from your site!</strong> Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/">this page</a>. Right click on links still works.</li>

	<li><strong>Lazyload mode</strong><br>
		Make your site load <strong>faster</strong> by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.<br>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Lazyload -&gt; Lightbox</strong><br>
		Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image</li>

	<li><strong>Link -&gt; Lightbox</strong><br>
		Use simple links as triggers for lightboxed videos</li>

	<li>Custom thumbnail images</li>
	<li>Custom titles on top of your thumbnails</li>
	<li>'Grow on click' feature</li>
	<li>3 hover styles</li>
	<li>2 play icon styles to choose from</li>
